### Some more info and issues

It took me 4 iterations of iris model, i left my previous attemps in freecad files. The last attempt should work as the model was built with beeing parametric in mind. Although freecad has topologic nameing bug of which i was not aware during modeling. So the models might break while changing some parameters, I am not sure.
